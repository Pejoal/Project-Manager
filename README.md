## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For running the containerized environment
- **PHP**: 8.2 or higher (for Composer)
- **Composer**: v2 or higher
- **Node.js**: v19.1.0 or higher
- **npm**: Latest version
- **Git**: For version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pejoal/manager.git
   cd manager
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   **Important**: Edit the `.env` file and configure:
   - Database credentials (DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD)
   - Application URL (APP_URL)
   - Meilisearch master key (MEILISEARCH_KEY)
   - Mail configuration (for notifications)
   - Reverb configuration (for real-time features)

3. **Install Laravel Sail (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   composer require laravel/sail --dev --ignore-platform-reqs
   ```

4. **Create a convenient shell alias:**

   ```bash
   alias sail="./vendor/bin/sail"
   ```

   Add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistence.

5. **Start the Docker containers:**

   ```bash
   sail up -d
   ```

   This starts:
   - Laravel application (http://localhost)
   - MariaDB database (port 3306)
   - Meilisearch (http://localhost:7700)
   - phpMyAdmin (http://localhost:81)

6. **Install PHP dependencies:**

   ```bash
   sail composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
   ```

7. **Generate application key:**

    ```

    This is crucial for search functionality to work properly.

12. **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    sail npm install
    ```

13. **Start development servers:**

    Open **two separate terminal windows/tabs**:

    **Terminal 1 - Vite development server:**

    ```bash
    sail npm run dev
    ```

### Customization Best Practices

1. **Plan Your Workflow:**
   - Map your organization's workflow before customizing
   - Consider existing processes and terminology
   - Ensure status names are clear and unambiguous

2. **Color Coding:**
   - Use consistent color schemes across related items
   - Red typically indicates urgency or issues
   - Green typically indicates completion or success
   - Blue typically indicates active work
   - Yellow/Orange typically indicates caution or pending states

3. **Status Progression:**
   - Design statuses to follow logical progression
   - Consider which statuses can transition to others
   - Mark appropriate statuses as "completed" for accurate tracking

4. **Priority Levels:**
   - Don't create too many priority levels (3-5 is optimal)
   - Ensure clear distinction between priority levels
   - Define criteria for each priority level

5. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review unused statuses/priorities
   - Archive or delete obsolete configurations
   - Update colors and names as workflow evolves

### System Settings
